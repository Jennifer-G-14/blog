## Node.js
I am currently working on a prject that is using node. I am not sure what exactly node is so I will be writting down somethings that I learn here.

# What is Node.js ? 
Node.js is a cross-platform, open-source back-end JavaScript runtime environment that uses the V8 engine to execute JavaScript code outside of a web browser.

# What can Node.js be used for?
Because of its single-threaded* nature, Node. js is best suited for non-blocking, event-driven servers.It was created with real-time, push-based architectures in mind and is utilized for standard web sites and back-end API applications. 

* The quantity of work accomplished by software that operates as a single stream of instructions in a given length of time is referred to as single thread performance.

# Benefits?
* Easy scaleability 
* Easy to learn             
* Large community support
* High performance

# Downfall?
* APIs can be unstable
* Weak library system
