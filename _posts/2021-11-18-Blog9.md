# Using Github and some tips
I am working on a project and I am not that familiar with the Github website. It has a lot to offer and is great to use when working on a project. Tasks can be issued, updates can be done easily and collaboration is all-around easier.

## What exactly is Github?
The "git" in GitHub is an open-source version control system that is used on the command line. I go more into detail on my previous blog. Github allows users to create repositories that can be used by individuals and teams to use Git for version control and collaboration. 

## Some things Github can offer
1. Documentation: Github is great for documentation and makes it easy
2. Showcase your work easily: Add a link to your Github repository when you can to make it easy for others to see what you have been working on.
3. Track changes to your work: This allows you to easily track your progress and who is making changes during the duration of a project.
