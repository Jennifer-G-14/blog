## This blog will be about Docker Compose
Docker Compose is anÂ application that allows you to define and operate multi-container Docker applications. You configure your application's services using Compose using a YAML file. Then you build and start all of the services from your setup with a single command.

# Things Docker Compose will do 
* When containers are built, keep volume data safe.
  * All volumes used by your services are preserved in Compose. If docker-compose discovers any containers from prior runs, it moves their volumes to the new container. This procedure ensures that any data stored in volumes is not lost.
  
* Only the containers that have changed will be recreated.
  * Compose saves the container's configuration. Compose re-uses the current containers when you restart a service that has not changed. You may modify your environment rapidly by reusing containers.

* Variables and moving a composition between environments
  * In the Compose file, variables are supported. These variables can be used to adapt your composition for different contexts or users.
