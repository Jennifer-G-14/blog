Terraform is an open-source infrastructure as code software. It was created by HashiCorp Users can use the HashiCorp Configuration Language or JSON to define and provide data center infrastructure.

# What can you do with Terraform 
It is possible to specify both cloud and on-premise resources using Terraform, which allows you to create human-readable configuration files that can be versioned and reused, as well as shared with others. Afterwards, you may follow a standardized workflow to provide and manage all of your infrastructure over its entire lifecycle.

# The benefits of using Terraform 
Infrastructure may be managed across a range of cloud platforms using Terraform's infrastructure management capabilities. In order to facilitate the rapid creation of infrastructure code, a human-readable configuration language is used. It is possible to keep track of resource changes as they occur throughout your Terraform deployments thanks to the state feature of Terraform. You can use version control to collaborate safely on infrastructure by committing your configurations to it.
