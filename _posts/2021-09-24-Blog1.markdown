# Python Crash Course Day 2!
In this lesson I will be introducing Python Variables.

## What is a Python Variable?
In Python, every value has a datatype. Variables can be given any name or even alphabets.

## The syntax for a variable
The name of the variable followed by the value 
Example:

x = 10
print (x)

output: 10 

## Naming Rules for Variables
Variables have some rules when declaring them.

1) A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character.
   Example: num1, input
2) A variable name cannot start with a number.
   Example: 1num 
3) A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores.
   Example: num_1, user_input
4) Variable names are case-sensitive (name, Name and NAME are three different variables).
5) The reserved words(keywords) cannot be used naming the variable.
