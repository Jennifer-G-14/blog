## Blockchain
This blog will be about blockchain!

# What is it?
With Blockchain, companies can record transactions and maintain track of assets in a digital ledger. Whether tangible or intangible, anyone looking to acquire or sell something valuable can utilize a blockchain to keep a record of it.

# Why is blockchain important? 
Data is important! The quicker and more accurate data can be, the better a company or person will be. A blockchain network can only get information from a ledger that can't be changed. Blockchain is a great way to spread information quickly and accurately. Any transactions can be kept track of. Because all members of a company have the same view,Â you can see the whole transaction from start to finish, giving you more confidence and efficient.

# How it works?
As each transaction is made, it is saved as a "block." In the data block, you can store essential data. This chain of blocks grows as an asset moves or its owner changes. The blocks are tightly linked together so that no black can be changed or added between two other blocks. As each new block is added, the previous block's verification is strengthened, and the blockchain is made more robust. This eliminates the chance of tampering and builds trust in the network.
