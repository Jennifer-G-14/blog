## This Blog will be about the DevOps Life Cycle

# What stages are involved in the DevOps Life Cycle?
1) Development
2) Integration
3) Testing
4) Deployment
5) Monitoring 
6) Feedback
7) Operations
   
# Development 
The software development process combines planning and coding. This phase is critical for mapping the vision for the whole development cycle and ensuring that developers have a complete understanding of project requirements.

# Integration
The integration processÂ contains various steps. Clients submit information about new application functionalities. During this period, most code modifications occur.

# Testing 
The developed code is checked for any bugs or errors that may have crept into it.

# Deployment
Ensures smooth product deployment without compromising application performance. During this phase, it is critical to verify that the code is deployed precisely on all available servers.

# Monitoring
Monitoring a software product's performance is critical to assessing its overall efficacy. This phase analyzes the app's data.

# Feedback
Feedback is vital to determining and analyzing the application's outcome. On the basis of stakeholder comments, it improves the existing version.

# Operations 
The final level of the DevOps lifecycle is the simplest to grasp. Achieving DevOps continuity helps automate release procedures, spot errors faster, and build better software products.
