## All about linters
This blog will discuss linters

# What are linters
Lint is a code analyzer. Checking your code for mistakes in both programming and style is called "linting." Programming errors are something that everyone is familiar with. Some endanger the safety and security of a mission-critical system by failing to do so. It is critical to avoid these pitfalls no matter what type of program you are developing or modifying. This is one of the primary reasons to use linting.

# Benefits of linters
1. Fewer errors
   - The usage of linters aids in the diagnosis and resolution of technical issues. As a result, there are fewer defects in production.
2. More consistent code
   - Linters, by enforcing its rules, can assist teams in achieving a more understandable and coherent style.
3. Measurement of code quality
   - When it comes to code quality, it's all too easy to get carried away. Linters are used to examine the quality of code in a clear and objective manner.

# When to use them 
It should happen early on in the development cycle, before code reviews and test. This is due to the fact that automated code checks make code review and testing more efficient. They also enable your developers to focus on the tasks that matter most to them.
